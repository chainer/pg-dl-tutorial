# 1. Prepare a dataset

Chainer contains some built-in functions to use some popular datasets like MNIST, CIFAR10/100, etc. Those can automatically download the data from servers and provide dataset objects which are easy to use.

The code shows how to retrieve the MNIST dataset from the server and save an image from its training split to make sure the images are correctly obtained.

The saved image `5.png` will look like:
